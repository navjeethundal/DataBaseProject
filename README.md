Users
There are two main different types of users of our appointment booking system: customers and staff members. 

The customers are ultimately who this system is designed for: it allows them to select an appointment type, select the therapist they want to see, and then make an appointment request. 

The staff members manage the system and maintain the information in the system. They log-in and access the staff-only back end of the booking system and can do things like add therapists to the system, add services to the system, associate services with therapists, view their appointments, book time off (for vacations), look up customers, etc....
